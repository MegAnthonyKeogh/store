# store

This project is an online photography store. As a new developer, this is the most complex project I have done to date. Thus, if you see anything that may be incorrect please do not hesitate to reach out. I've design this online store to mimic enterprise level applications. By having additional layers, there's more security and loosely coupled features that allow you to fix/change pieces without completely breaking the application.
